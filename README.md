# Space-Battleships
This is a self-motivated project to create a Battleship game, but with a space-themed twist.

The game itself has original music created by myself using MAGIX Music Maker (the free trial). There are three sound tracks that have been produced.

The first  is for the main game music, the second is played when the player wins the game and the final track is played when the player loses.

The sound effects all come from SoundBible.com and are royalty free sound clips, consisting of explosions and laser sound effects. Below are the sources.
Laser Cannon: Played when an attack is made. http://soundbible.com/1771-Laser-Cannon.html
Barrel Exploding: Played when either player has hit an opponent's ship. http://soundbible.com/576-Barrel-Exploding.html
Grenade Explosion: Player when an enemy ship has been destroyed. http://soundbible.com/1467-Grenade-Explosion.html
